# My Blog

This uses the Hugo framework and the [Congo](https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/congo/) theme. 

'Emptypad Red' (#b3a3a3 or rgb(179, 163, 163)) is used as the text color for primary text/headings.

## TODO

- [ ] Remove images/summaries from homepage of blog and move them into the markdown folder itself
- [ ] Restructure the pages so there's a better structure to the MD files (maybe make it by year too or something)
- [ ] Work on GB emulator blog post (can be really simple, doesn't need to be a hardware overview)

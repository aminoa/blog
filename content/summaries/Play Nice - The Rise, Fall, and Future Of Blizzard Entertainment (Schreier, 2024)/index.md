I started this book late November last year and I finished it yesterday on April 7th, so it took me about 5 months to finish this book (wow). I'll have text blurbs for interesting ideas from the book rather than serving as a chronological summary. Also, this will be one of the longer summaries, most of my summaries in the future will likely only be a couple paragraphs or so.

## Early Years at Blizzard

- 1991: Blizzard was founded as Silicon and Synapse by Allen Adham and Mike Morhaime, graduates from UCLA. 
-  Taking contracts from Interplay with assistance from Brian Fargo but created their first game, Warcraft, as a multiplayer fantasy variant of Dune II. 
- Warcraft II emphasized approachability and depth for the sequel and was the first big success, selling 1 million copies, as well as establishing the company structure of QA teams. 
- Diablo was developed by a separate studio (Condor) as a contract. 
- Compensation was continually stifled and there was continual crunch.
- Starcraft was a massive success, in particular benefitting from internet infrastructure being built in Thailand and South Korea and the start of PC Cafes. 

- Blizzard attempted to make a point and click adventure Warcraft game but canceled it, even after bringing in Steve Meretzky, the legendary designer behind adventure games like Sorceror and Zork Zero. 


##  Before Overwatch
	
- World of Warcraft 
	- It was based off the successful EverQuest MMORPG. 
	- Relied on homegrown talent from QA/testers
	- Inspired early internet memes and forming a collaboration with South Park. 
	
- Failure of Titan
	- 2008: development began as a new MMORPG, combining FPS game with sim game. 
	- FPS portion was prelude to Overwatch which was a grand success for Blizzard, though not completely satisfying Kotich

- Heartstone
	- The game idea was incubated by a smaller team (as other developers shifted to work on battle.net)
	- An unexpected hit 

- Diablo 3: launch missteps and the auction house was improperly done
	- Financial people at the game recommended that they don't overcharge so monetization serves players well - this never happened at the company again
	- Reaper of Souls fixed the game up
	- Morhaime's regret: not continuing to support the game

- Heroes of the Storm
	- DotA was a custom map in Warcraft III, developed by Icefrog, foucsed on singular units rather than commanding many
		- Valve contacted the developer and helped create DotA 2
	- Riot Games created League of Legends as another game based on that mode
	- The first time Blizzard missed the boat
	
- Battle.net
	- Pat Wyatt came up a novel idea: to provide free online infrastructure for Diablo and Starcraft, 
		- Mike Morhaime approved, wanting to serve the players right. 
	- He thought of a lucrative, industry-changing initiative: to turn Battle.net into a digital store for a variety of PC games instead of just Blizzard’s (this was shot down by executives who wanted to focus on Blizzard).
	- Big mistake in retrospect


## Parental struggle for Blizzard

- Initially owned by Davidsons and Associates (an educational game company) which was bought by CUC (a consumer services conglomerate)
	- That company committed substantial financial fraud (overstating merger reserves that were reported as earnings). 
- 1997: Blizzard was sold to publisher Havas which was itself purchased by Vivendi
- 2008: Activision merged itself with Vivendi Games, with Kotich leveraging his connections at JP Morgan and making the debt into shares to gain ownership
- 2023: Microsoft buys Activision-Blizzard after turmoil from sexual assault scandals

## Esports

- After Starcraft took off in Korea, KESPA was founded to handle licensing for the sport 
	- contentious meetings between Blizzard and KESPA - 'you're the ball'
- For Starcraft II, Starcraft reached an agreement with the organization.
- Overwatch emphasized esports with a professional league owned and operated by Blizzard.
	- Blizzard was interested in investing in Twitch but hesitated, leading Amazon to take the company.
	- OVerwatch also introduced lootboxes (1 billion in revenue)
	- They charged $20 million per franchise (Kotich pushed the number so high to get the interest of billionaire sports teams owners to invest)
		- Got owners of NFL teams (ex. Robert Kraft) to invest
		- Overwatch League was different in that the organization was set up to give Blizzard money
- However, game updates were slow and Team 4 resisted commercialization (including sponsorships)
- Overwatch 2, with most of its development focused on a PvE mode rather than the main PvP mode, came out half-baked. 
- The pandemic and the switch to YouTube were the final nails in the coffin, with the league ending in 2023

## Clashes between Activision and Blizzard

- Bobby Kotich grew up always interested in generating profits (with smaller businesses when he was younger)
- He and his roommate took a look at Mediagenic, started to fail despite creating hits long ago. 
	- Kotich acquired the company, renamed it to its old name Activision, and was ruthless, heavily rewarding and punishing the people there. 
- Brought in Armin Zerzha who was hated at Blizzard, fixated on profits 
	- He eventually became CFO
- Blizzards culture contrasted as letting games simmer and given the proper time. This contrasted heavily with Ac culture.

- Activision's corporatization of Blizzard
	- Stack ranking introduced.
	- Profit-sharing weighted toward hit games 
	- There was still a Blizzard "tax": High prestige, low pay.
	- QA and testers underpaid, overworked.
	

## Cultural Issues 

- Frat-like - company retreats to Las Vegas for partying, alcohol and blurred personal-professional boundaries 
- Emphasized a blurring of lines in terms of personal life and corporate life
- Women pushed out and not in leadership
- 2023 - California Lawsuit
	- While mildly inaccurate, it highlighted sexist behavior at the company (example, a manager hitting on his suboordinate)
	- WSJ article - Kotich sent email dismissing the lawsuit and saved a COD producer after an investigation suggested that he should be fired

## Microsoft Acquisition

- $69 billion - October 13, 2023
	- FTC's lawsuit failed after Xbox promised COD on PS
- Leadership - Mike Ybarra as President and Xbox's Matt Booty - emphasized hands off approach
	- Layoffs after and Adham's two projects cancelled, so he left the company (all founders gone)

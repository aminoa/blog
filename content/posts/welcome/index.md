I hesitated starting a blog while at NYU due to wanting to avoid my opinions being too simplistic/not nuanced and having something unique to say. However, while working on the story for Feature (the mascot of [BUGS@NYU](https://bugsnyu.com)), I dove much deeper into open source history than I initally intended - fascinated by the topic, I decided to write a post on that. 

## What to expect

Posts discussing emulation, progress updates on larger projects I'm working on, complaining about NYU as a former student (a pastime for many Tandon students), or anything else I've been interested in. 

## Hugo?

I previously used Hugo for my [old personal website](https://github.com/aminoa/personal-website) but scrapped it since it felt too generic. However, for this blog, I'm ok with the design being a bit less interesting; furthermore, I have taken steps to modify the Congo hugo theme to make it more interesting.

## The name?

It's a reference to [Stale Reference Manipulation](https://www.zeldaspeedruns.com/oot/srm/srm-overview), a powerful glitch in The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time.

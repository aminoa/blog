I hesitated starting a blog while at NYU due to wanting to avoid my opinions being too simplistic/not nuanced and having something unique to say. However, while working on the story for Feature (the mascot of [BUGS@NYU](https://bugsnyu.com)), I dove much deeper into open source history than I initally intended to so I decided to write a post on that. 

## What to expect

Posts discussing emulation, progress updates on larger projects I'm working on, complaining about NYU as a former student (a pastime for many Tandon students), or anything else I've been interested in. 

## Hugo?

I previously used Hugo for my [old personal website](https://github.com/aminoa/personal-website) but scrapped it since it felt too generic. For a personal portfolio, I find it important that it represents you so I would prefer to avoid static site generators. However, for a blog, I find the design is less important than the entries themselves.
